			<p class="list-header">Premium Account Audits</p>
			<p>We perform regular audits of employer records using generally accepted auditing standards. An audit may examine at least four consecutive quarters during which an employer was in business and liable for reporting covered wages and premiums under the law, however this may be expanded at any time during the audit. Additionally, an audit may be conducted on an employer that has been in business less than four complete calendar quarters.</p>

			<p>The objectives are to verify employer reporting, obtain reports and payments, ensure compliance with the Colorado Employment Security Act, analyze the financial status of the employer, secure claimant wage data, explain employer rights, and determine the overpayment of premiums.</p>

			<p>We may collect any taxes that are owed as a result of the audit. If a full collection is not possible, the account is referred to Unemployment Insurance Employer Services Premiums for collections.</p>

			<p>Overall, field audits enable unemployment insurance to maintain a good relationship with the employer community, foster employers’ understanding of what the law requires and compliance with all of the premium provisions of the law. </p>

			<p class="list-header">Claim Audits</p>
			<p>We also conduct audits on claims to prevent overpayments to claimants. During a claim audit, we request payroll information for a specific period of time from an employer. We evaluate the hours worked plus earnings and compare it to what the claimant has reported. This information may be used to alter a claimant’s unemployment benefits. </p>
			<p>We accept responses online through <a href="https://myuiemployer.coworkforce.com" target="_blank">MyUI Employer</a> via the <span>Request to Employer for Earnings Data</span>.</p>

         <p>Employee/worker misclassification occurs when an employer mistakenly classifies a worker as an independent contractor rather than an employee.</p>

			<p>Colorado law assumes that service performed by an individual for another is deemed to be employment, unless:</p>
			<ol class="misclass-list-1">
				<li>It is shown that the individual performing the service is free from control and direction in that performance</li>
				<p class="list-divider">-and-</p>
				<li>The individual is customarily engaged in an independent trade, occupation, profession, or business related to that service.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Generally, it is the employer’s responsibility to establish that both these conditions exist.</p>

			<p>Additionally, we evaluate the overall “totality of circumstances” to make a determination. The “totality of the circumstances” test is based upon an assessment of 9 different factors contained within Colorado law. This is not an exhaustive list and other relevant factors may be considered.</p>

			<p class="list-header">There are 9 factors that demonstrate correct classification</p>
			<p>An employer must not:</p>
			<ol class="misclass-list-2">
				<li>Require the individual to work exclusively for the person for whom services are performed; except that the individual may choose to work exclusively for the said person for a finite period of time specified in the document;</li>
				<li>Establish a quality standard for the individual; except that such person can provide plans and specifications regarding the work but cannot oversee the actual work or instruct the individual as to how the work will be performed;</li>
				<li>Pay a salary or hourly rate but rather a fixed or contract rate;</li>
				<li>Terminate the work during the contract period unless the individual violates the terms of the contract or fails to produce a result that meets the specifications of the contract;</li>
				<li>Provide more than minimal training for the individual;</li>
				<li>Provide tools or benefits to the individual; except that materials and equipment may be supplied;</li>
				<li>Dictate the time of performance; except that a completion schedule and a range of mutually agreeable work hours may be established;</li>
				<li>Pay the individual personally but rather make checks payable to the trade or business name of the individual; and</li>
				<li>Combine his business operations in any way with the individual’s business, but instead maintains such operations as separate and distinct.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The independent contractor is obligated to pay federal and state income tax on any moneys paid pursuant to the contract-labor relationship.</p>

			<p>Many employers in Colorado are required to pay employees a minimum wage. </p>
			<p>If an employee is covered by federal and Colorado state minimum wage laws, then the employer must pay the higher minimum wage. Federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, which is lower than the Colorado state minimum wage of $7.78. Therefore, based upon current information, covered employers in Colorado will have to pay their employees the higher value of $7.78 per hour under Colorado law.</p>

			<p>Employees who are covered by Colorado Minimum Wage Order Number 29 may, in certain circumstances, qualify for overtime pay. The following information only applies to non-exempt employees covered by the Wage Order.</p>

			<p class="list-header">Overtime Hours</p>
			<p>Employees shall be paid time and one-half of the regular rate of pay for any work in excess of: (1) forty hours per workweek; (2) twelve hours per workday, or (3) twelve consecutive hours without regard to the starting and ending time of the workday (excluding duty free meal periods), whichever calculation results in the greater payment of wages.</p>

			<p class="list-header">Workweek Definition and Overtime</p>
			<p>A workweek is defined as any consecutive seven-day period starting with the same calendar day and hour each week. A workweek is a fixed and recurring period of 168 hours, seven consecutive twenty-four hour periods, and is typically established by the employer. Hours worked in two or more workweeks shall not be averaged for computation of overtime.</p>

			<p class="list-header">Regular Rate of Pay</p>
			<p>The regular rate of pay for an employee is used to calculate overtime pay. The regular rate of pay is expressed as a rate per hour, and it is determined by dividing the total remuneration provided to an employee in any workweek by the total numbers of hours actually worked in that workweek.</p>

			<p>The regular rate of pay includes all compensation paid to employees including the set hourly rate, shift differential, non-discretionary bonuses, production bonuses, and commissions.</p>

			<p>The following are excludable from the regular rate of pay: business expenses, bona fide gifts, discretionary bonuses, employer investment contributions, vacation pay, holiday pay, sick leave, or jury duty.</p>
